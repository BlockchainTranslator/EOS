**Almost a decade ago, Satoshi Nakamoto**, the creator of Bitcoin, silently disrupted trust-providing organizations, like banks, with an eight-page long research paper describing how money can be decentralized (through Bitcoin). At the time, not many people understood the potential that those eight pages concealed within themselves.

十年前，当比特币的创始人中本聪发布了一个八页长的研究报告，报告默默地打破了像银行一样的可资信赖机构的垄断，描述了如何通过比特币将现金去中心化。当时只有极少数人明白隐藏在这八页纸背后的非凡的潜力。

No, I am not talking about decentralizing money. I am referring to the decentralization itself. In those eight pages, Nakamoto didn’t just explain how we can regain control over our money — he offered a new way for strangers to safely collaborate with each other.

这里我不谈论去中心化的货币，我指的是去中心化本身。在这八页中，中本聪让我们重新取得对自己的金钱的完全控制（指不需要通过任何的金融机构） - 它也为陌生人之间的安全合作提供了一种新的方式。

You might have come across people who deny the potential of blockchains and tell you not to buy into the hype. My advice: do not pay too much attention to them.

你可能会遇到那些怀疑区块链的潜力的人，并告诉你不要买入炒作比特币。我的建议是：不用太在意这些人。

>The businesses who don’t adapt to the decentralized world of the future will soon become businesses of the past.

>不适应未来去中心化世界的企业很快就会成为过去的企业。

In this article, we discuss five different ways blockchain will fit into your company in less than ten years from now. So let’s start with the basics: what is blockchain exactly?

在这篇文章中，我们将讨论末来十年内区块链应用在公司中的五种不同方式。让我们从最基础的开始：到底什么是区块链？


Put simply, a blockchain is a database. It’s an ever-growing database of different kinds of data and it has quite remarkable properties:

简单来说，区块链是一个数据库。不断增长，并且存放着各种数据的数据库，具有非常显着的以下特性：

1. Once data is stored in the database, it can never be modified or deleted. Every record on a blockchain is permanent for eternity.

2. No single individual or organization maintains the database; several thousand individuals do, and everyone has a copy of the database themselves.

1、 一旦数据存储在数据库中，它就永远不会被修改或删除。区块上的每个记录将永久保存。

2、 不是由个别人或组织维护操控数据库; 它由几千个人维护且每个人都保存有数据库本身。

To understand how several people are able to keep their copies of the database in sync with everyone else’s, imagine this:

数据是如何跟所有其他人的数据库保持同步的呢？我们想象一下：

There are ten individuals in a network. Everyone is sitting with an empty folder and a blank page in front of them. Whenever anyone does something important in the network, like transferring money, they announce it to everyone in the network.

假设网络中有十个人。每个人都坐在一个空的文件夹和一个空白页面前面。每当有人在网络中做重要的事情，例如转移资金，他就会向网络中的其它人公告。

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Q_YwXlxhxiA4pBhn.png)

Everyone makes a note of each announcement on their page until their pages are full. When they’re full, everyone has to seal the contents of their page by solving a mathematical puzzle. Solving a mathematical puzzle verifies that everyone’s page has the same contents and ensures they can never be modified. Whoever seals their page first, gets rewarded with some amount of cryptocurrency.

每个人都在他们的页面上记录每个公告，直到页面写满。当页面写满时，每个人都必须通过解决一个数学难题来密封他们的页面的内容。解决数学难题会验证每个人的页面是否具有相同的内容，并确保不会被修改。谁首先密封页面，将获得一些额外的加密货币奖励。

Once the page is sealed, it is added to the folder. A new page is brought out and the process continues forever.

当页面被密封后，它将被添加到文件夹中。再取出一个新的空白页，然后循环该过程，并且永远持续下去。


![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*w3Gb08w9KlfMR-mE.png)

As time passes, these pages (blocks) that contain important records (transactions) are added to the folder (chain), thus forming the database (blockchain).

随着时间的流逝，包含重要记录（事务）的这些页面（块）被添加到文件夹（链），从而形成数据库（区块链）。

更多细节，请查看 [blockchain 最终指南](https://hackernoon.com/wtf-is-the-blockchain-1da89ba19348)。

Because of its unique properties, blockchain technology can be used in many different industries, ranging from banking and accounting to [the entertainment industry](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/08/15/five-ways-blockchain-tech-going-rock-music-movie-industries/#.tnw_NmV3zr9H).

由于其独特的特性，区块链技术可用于从银行、会计到[娱乐业](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/08/15/five-ways-blockchain-tech-going-rock-music-movie-industries/#.tnw_NmV3zr9H)等许多不同行业。

Below, we discuss five different ways blockchain will affect your company.

下面，我们将讨论区链接将影响您公司的五种不同方式。

### 1) Contracts 📝合同

“Until the contract is signed, nothing is real.”
— Glenn Danzig

“在合同签署之前，什么都不是真的。” — Glenn Danzig

**What would you call a business** that isn’t “doing business?” Blockchain will have a large impact on the way organizations engage with one another. Doing business means transacting with other parties to facilitate something that wouldn’t be possible alone. In such an arrangement, the two organizations need to be sure they can trust each other.

有“不做生意”的生意吗？区块链将对组织间互相交流的方式产生巨大的影响。做生意意味着与其他各方进行交易，以完成不可能单独完成的事情。这种方式下，双方需要确信能相互彼此信任。

In 2017, this trust is provided by a set of pages, or contract, that lists all the terms and conditions of engagement. When a party doesn’t adhere to the promises mentioned in the contract it can be enforced by law — but this can result in an expensive and timely process. So **in many cases, going to court over a breach of contract simply isn’t worth the trouble**.

在2017年，这种信任由列出所有参与条款和条件的一组页面或合同提供。当一方不遵守合同中提到的承诺时，可以按法律处理 - 但这可能需要花费昂贵的费用和过多的时间。所以在很多情况下，违反合同是不值得的。

Using blockchain technology, many of these contracts can be converted into Smart Contracts. Unlike conventional contracts, smart contracts consist of software code and are executed by the blockchain network. The beauty of these smart contracts is that they cannot be modified after they are deployed, which ensures neither party in a deal can walk away without doing their part.

使用区块链技术，这其中的许多合同可以转换为智能合约。与常规合同不同，智能合约由软件代码组成，并由区块链网络执行。智能合约的优点在于它们在部署之后不能被修改，这确保了交易中的任何一方都不会在没有执行合约的情况下离开。

Smart contracts, written in code on the blockchain, are contracts that are completely inalterable once they have been triggered.

智能合约，是以代码编写，运行在区块链上，并且一旦被触发完全不可更改的合同。

Imagine you’re in a band and you want to sell your music to someone, meaning you’ll have to transfer an audio file. How can you be sure the buyer will pay for it after receiving it? At the same time, the buyer might be skeptical too, thinking you won’t send the audio file if they make the payment first. A smart contract ensures that once the buyer has transferred the money, the audio file will immediately be sent to the buyer. Once deployed, no one can stop the contract from being executed. So both parties can trust the code.

想像你拥有一个乐队，想把你的音乐卖给某人，这意味着你必须转移一个音频文件。你怎么能确定买家在收到货物后会付款呢？同时，买方也可能疑虑，如果先付款，您可能不发送音频文件。智能合约确保一旦买家付钱，音频文件将立即发送给买方。智能合约一旦部署，没有人可以阻止合同执行。所以双方都可以相信它。


### 2) Payments💸付款

“If you think nobody cares about you, try missing a couple of payments.”
— Steven Wright

“如果您认为没人在乎你，可以试试不付帐单。” — Steven Wright

**If your business requires payment transactions** between countries, blockchains will come in handy as well . One of the biggest promises of blockchain is that it will replace money someday. This, of course, would entail such a radical shift that it would take years, if not decades, to happen. But right now, we can already use blockchains to transfer money across the globe within minutes, instead of days.

如果您的业务需要各个国家之间的付款交易，区块链也将派上用场。区块链最大的前景之一就是有一天会取代金钱。带来如此彻底的变化，当然这将需要几年甚至几十年后才会发生。但是现在，我们已经可以使用区块链在几分钟内转移金钱，而不是几天。

One of the benefits of decentralized money is that payments can be transferred directly between peers, without any intermediaries, like banks, slowing down the process. Given this, cross-border remittances will no doubt be another area of your business that will adopt blockchain.

去中心化货币的一个好处是，支付可以在两方直接转移，而不需要任何像银行一样的造成交易缓慢的中介机构。鉴于此，区块链上的跨境汇款无疑将成为您的业务的另一个领域。

### 3) Recruiting 👩🏻‍🚀招聘

“We’re going to become caretakers for the robots. That’s what the next generation of work is going to be.”

— Gray Scott

我们将成为机器人的照顾者。这就是下一代人的工作。“ — Gray Scott


**[Experts predict](https://gizmodo.com/robots-are-already-replacing-human-workers-at-an-alarmi-1793718198) that robots will someday** take over our jobs. But until that day arrives, CEO’s everywhere will still need humans running their companies.

[专家预测](https://gizmodo.com/robots-are-already-replacing-human-workers-at-an-alarmi-1793718198)机器人有一天将会接管我们的工作。但那一天到来这前，企业经理仍然需要人来管理经营他们的公司。

Unlike robots, however, people do not come with trademarks or reputation badges. Which is why finding the right employees for your company can be a daunting task.

但是跟机器人不同，人不会附带商标或声誉徽章。就这是为什么公司要找到合适的员工是一项艰巨的任务。

But what if such information about possible new hires became publicly available? As explored [in this article](https://hackernoon.com/what-role-can-blockchain-play-when-hunting-for-a-new-job-1ede32aa0711), blockchains can pave the way for faster, cheaper and trustless (where you don’t have to trust another human being for authenticity) reference checks. Each person would have a trail of feedback which would be accumulated over the course of their career by past employers. This would enable new employers to quickly review this trail and decide whether this person would be the right match for the job.

但是如果有关新员工的这些信息公开并可取得？正如[这篇文章](https://hackernoon.com/what-role-can-blockchain-play-when-hunting-for-a-new-job-1ede32aa0711)所探讨的那样，使用区块链可以使雇主更快，更便宜和无信赖（您不必相信另一个人的真实性）查看检查这些信息。每个人在职业生涯中都会有过去雇主积累的反馈信息。这将使新雇主能够快速审查这些信息，并决定这个人能否胜任工作。

Convenient enough for the new employer, but what happens if this trail contains false information? Suppose your previous boss was a hateful, horrible person — will you then be forever haunted by their negative feedback?

这样对于新雇主来说很方便，但是如果区块链上包含虚假信息会发生什么？假设你以前的老板是一个可恶的可怕的人，那么你会永远受到他们的负面反馈的困扰吗？

To make sure this doesn’t happen, the reference system should be a two-way street. This way employees can also rate their employers, and if needed, each other. A bad rating from an employer with a bad reputation in the system will have less weight than someone who’s proven trustworthy.

为了防止这种情况出现，系统应该是双向的。这样，员工也可以对他们的雇主进行评估，如果需要，也可以双方互评。 并且声誉不好的雇主的评分权重将比有信誉的雇主低。

### 4) Cloud storage 💾云存储

“Behind every cloud is another cloud.”
— Judy Garland

每一个云层背后是另外一片云” — Judy Garland

**If you’re running a business**, chances are you have company data stored in the cloud. [According to a recent report](https://www.bcsg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-small-business-revolution-trends-in-SMB-cloud-adoption.pdf) by cloud services provider BCSG, a growing number of small and medium-sized companies are turning to cloud computing. Currently, 64% of small business owners have an average of three cloud solutions in place, which is expected to increase to 72% in the next three years.

**如果您正在开展业务**，您有机会将公司数据存储在云端。[根据云服务提供商BCSG 最近的一份报告](https://www.bcsg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-small-business-revolution-trends-in-SMB-cloud-adoption.pdf)，越来越多的中小型企业正在转向云计算。目前，64％的小企业主平均有三种云解决方案，预计未来三年将增长到72％。


Blockchains are playing a huge role in decentralizing cloud storage because they allow strangers to collaborate with each other. Instead of storing files on a single centralized server, you’ll be able to save your files on thousands of devices across the globe.

区块链在云存储去中心化中扮演着重要的角色，因为他们允许陌生人彼此协作。这样你可以将文件保存在全球数千种设备上，而不必将文件上传到一个中心化的服务器上。

Here’s how that works: Every file you upload will be divided into several tiny chunks, and each of these chunks will be stored on several devices in the network. Which particular chunk is stored on which particular device is recorded on the blockchain. If you need to retrieve that file, the system will assemble it for you based on this information.

它是这样工作的：您上传的每个文件将被分成几个小块，并且每个这些块将被存储在网络中的多个设备上。哪个特定的块被存储在哪个特定的设备被记录在区块链上。如果您需要该文件，系统将根据这些信息将文件组合起来。

Your data will be even more secure in a decentralized storage than the cloud storage. While the centralized cloud storage stores your file on several backups, the decentralized storage will keep your data on an even bigger number of devices, therefore, increasing dependability.

您的数据在去中心化分散式存储中将比云存储更加安全。集中式云存储将您的文件存储在多个备份中时，中心化分散式存储将使您的数据保留在更多数量的设备上，从而提高可靠性。

Also, in centralized systems, the strength of the system depends on how secure one company’s servers are. Using decentralized networks, there isn’t just one device that contains the complete file, which makes it practically impossible for hackers to obtain the data.

此外，在集中式系统中，安全取决于一家公司的服务器的安全性。使用区块链，没有一个设备包含完整的文件，这使得黑客几乎不可能获取数据。

### 5) Less hierarchy, better governance 👨🏻‍🔧减少公司治理层次 提高管理效率

Companies will thrive in an environment where power is not limited to the hands of a few, yet this is the way organizations are often structured.

公司只有在权力在大多数人手中才能成长。这也是公司组织层次结构化的目标。

**These current authority structures** are the result of inefficiencies in coordinating a large crowd. Blockchain itself is not a new technology — it is just a combination of technologies that we’ve had for several decades: peer-to-peer networks and cryptography. Similarly, the solutions on top of blockchains are made up of several moving parts that work together beautifully.

大量的人员协调引起效率低下造成了当前的权力组织方式。区块链本身不是一种新技术 - 它仅仅是我们已经存在了几十年的技术的组合：对等网络和加密技术。类似地，区块链顶层的解决方案是由几个运行优良的可替换部件组成。


Using a combination of smart contracts on top of the blockchain, [communities can have a governance without a hierarchy](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/08/13/blockchain-can-build-communities-completely-free-hierarchy/#.tnw_wURQ1aEr). It’s very likely that your business will soon have next to zero bureaucracy, and all the major decisions that affect the organization as a whole might be taken through a transparent voting process that gets carried out on a blockchain.

使用组合在块链接之上的智能合约，就可以在[没有层次结构的情况下进行治理](https://thenextweb.com/contributors/2017/08/13/blockchain-can-build-communities-completely-free-hierarchy/#.tnw_wURQ1aEr)。很可能您的业务很快就会在零度的官僚作风之下，影响整个组织的所有重大决策都可能通过一个透明的投票过程来实现。

Every proposal gets submitted in the form of a Smart Contract on which everyone can vote. If the threshold defined in the company’s constitution is met, the proposal is approved and further steps can be taken.

每个提案都以智能合约的形式提交，每个人都可以投票。如果公司章程中定义的限定条件得到满足，该建议得到批准以采取进一步措施。

### Blockchain is coming… 区块链正在来临...

These are the few areas that your business might adopt blockchains sooner than you expect, but the possibilities are endless. There are several mental models that you can use to think of blockchains. When it comes to identifying the potential of blockchains in business, I like to think of blockchain as a method to make strangers work together. Be it your employees, or your partners, or the supply chain, or anybody else, blockchains will soon penetrate your organization in more ways than one.

这些是在你的业务中使用区块链技术的几个方面，它可能比你想象的更快到来。区块链技术的可能性是无止境的。有几种心理模型可以用来思考区块链。在区块链应用到企业业务的潜力方面，我喜欢把区块链作为使陌生人一起工作的有效方法。无论是您的员工，您的合作伙伴，供应链，还是其他任何人，区块链都将以更多的方式渗入您的组织。
